//Arrays shouldn't have spaces between the variable name and the brackets.
//Brackets fromleft to right start at the highest level array and work inward.

// Setup
var myArray = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [[10,11,12], 13, 14]];

// Only change code below this line. Make myData equal to 8.
var myData = myArray[2][1];
